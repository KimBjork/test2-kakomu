# kakomu
A simple bot able to play game of go in Kotlin.

The general approach is inspired by the book "Deep Learning And The Game of Go".
I introduced some optimizations and Kotlin idioms.

Currently it's using MonteCarlo Tree Search but hopefully it will also make use of DeepLearning.

The goals of Kakomu are:

- Enjoy and having fun

- Be able to experiment with MCTS, DeepLearning, etc

- Keep code simple and easy to understand and modify

- Get some hints on how to improve at Go

Not a goal:

- Make a top level AI player

- Create a framework for Go Game IA engine
