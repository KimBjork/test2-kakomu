A simple game of go in Kotlin based on BetaGo book

For the moment I will keep the code as close to the book as possible, name of methods, classes etc.

I will introduce Kotlin idiomatic and functional patterns, once I'll be more confident.

Once finished and tested I will hopefully introduce further optimizations.
